cmd is a program that allows shebang (#!) lines to pass multiple arguments:

#! /usr/bin/cmd sudo -u someuser sh

Where the normal behaviour would break here.

That's the basic use. It's more powerful than that: you can turn the shebang
line into an arbitrary shell expression to be evaluated. For details, see
